# train_motion_vqvae_2.yaml
compression rate: 8
scaled up already, but still not that good

# train_motion_vqvae_3.yaml
try larger model from proprior config, but only 4 times compression rate
this looks much better. Now further scale up the model



# train_motion_vqvae_4.yaml
try encoder/decoder with transformer models.

# train_motion_vqvae_5.yaml
smaller transformer model than train_motion_vqvae_4.yaml
not as good as 4

# train_motion_vqvae_6.yaml
same as train_motion_vqvae_4.yaml, just that load trajectory of size 8 instead of 16
much worse than 4

# currently 4, 5, 6 are all worse than 3 in terms of recon loss.





# train_motion_vqvae_7.yaml
source from train_motion_vqvae_3.yaml, but change to cross entropy loss
gripper_weight: 0.1

# train_motion_vqvae_8.yaml
gripper_weight: 0.01

# train_motion_vqvae_9.yaml
gripper_weight: 0.5



# train_motion_vqvae_10.yaml
add vision information
really cannot train



# train_motion_vqvae_11.yaml
try larger codebook of size 1024

# train_motion_vqvae_12.yaml
try larger codebook of size 1536

# train_motion_vqvae_13.yaml
try larger codebook of size 2048



# train_motion_vqvae_14.yaml
from train_motion_vqvae_3.yaml
load sparce trajectory

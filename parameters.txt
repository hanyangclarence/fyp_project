# train_motion_vqvae_2.yaml
compression rate: 8
scaled up already, but still not that good

# try larger model from proprior config, but only 4 times compression rate train_motion_vqvae_3.yaml
this looks much better. Now further scale up the model

# train_motion_vqvae_4.yaml
try encoder/decoder with transformer models.

# train_motion_vqvae_5.yaml
smaller transformer model than train_motion_vqvae_4.yaml

# train_motion_vqvae_6.yaml
same as train_motion_vqvae_4.yaml, just that load trajectory of size 8 instead of 16
